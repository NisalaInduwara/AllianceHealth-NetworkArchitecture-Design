# AllianceHealth-NetworkArchitecture-Design
The "AllianceHealth-NetworkArchitecture" repository is dedicated to the planning, design, and restructuring of the network architecture for Alliance Health, a technology-enabled solutions company expanding its operations with a new branch in Matara. The repository contains comprehensive resources, documentation, and code related to the network design and implementation, ensuring efficient communication and connectivity within the organization.

## Key Features
1. Network Architectural Design: Detailed plans, diagrams, and explanations of the network architecture for both the head office in Colombo and the new branch in Matara. The design emphasizes departmental separation, secure Wi-Fi connectivity, and intra-branch communication.

2. Implementation Guidelines: Step-by-step instructions and best practices for configuring network devices such as switches, routers, access points, and firewalls. These guidelines ensure the successful implementation of the network design and adherence to the project requirements.

3. IP Addressing Scheme: The necessary IP address classes and ranges are defined, with unique subnets allocated to each department. The design accommodates the required number of hosts while ensuring efficient IP address utilization and scalability.

4. Wi-Fi Connectivity: The network design incorporates Wi-Fi connectivity in the reception areas and customer service areas of both the head office and the branch. The configuration includes secure access points and the use of WPA2 security protocol to safeguard wireless communications.

5. Branch Connectivity: The design enables connectivity between the head office and the branch, facilitating intra-branch communication and collaboration. Site-to-site VPN tunnels can be established, ensuring secure and reliable connectivity between the two locations.

6. Server Room Setup: The design includes a dedicated server room with ten servers assigned IP addresses from the 10.254.10.0/24 subnet. Static IP addresses are used to ensure stable connections and proper server management.

7. Sales and Marketing Wi-Fi Access: The design enables the Sales and Marketing team to access network resources using the Wi-Fi network, allowing them flexibility and convenience while maintaining network security.

The repository provides a comprehensive documentation package, including network architectural designs, configuration files, and guidelines for implementing the proposed network infrastructure. This ensures effective communication, secure connectivity, and state-of-the-art facilities for Alliance Health's new branch in Matara.
